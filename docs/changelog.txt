This update includes new features, bug fixes, and config changes.

** New features **
- There is now a help menu which can be activated by doing `<prefix>help`. (Please note this is a hard-coded command.)
- You can now reply to a user saying that there may be a delay in response.
- When responding with a message that is too long to send, it tells you.

** Bug fixes **
- Fixed a bug where the bot would crash.
- Fixed an issue when bot would not show that the reply message failed to send.
- Fixed typo in command that sets the bot's activity.

** Code breaking changes **
- `info.json` and `strings.json` have been merged with `config.json`. 
- New commands mean you have to add those to your `config.json`.
